## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ I'm a Computer Science student currently enrolled in his 3rd Semester at FAST NUCES Islamabad.
- Passionate about learning and evolving as a problem solver, I continuously find myself trying to learn newer and more efficient ways to think about problems.
- Apart from college-related semester projects like PlantsVsZombies, I'm currently also working on my Front-End abilities as well as DSA.
